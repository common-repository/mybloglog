Adds MyBlogLog widgets and member pages to your blog.

== Description ==

MyBlogLog is a great service that lets you build an online community around your blog. Users can create extensive profiles, join communities, and interact with other users. With the release of their API, you can now access user and community data from within your own website. We have created a WordPress plugin which allows any WordPress blogger to integrate this information into their blog.

The MyBlogLog WordPress plugin provides two main features:

First, it makes two sidebar widgets available: recent readers and community members. If your WordPress installation and theme supports widgets, the MyBlogLog widgets will be available where you normally configure your widgets. If you are not using WordPress widgets, you can simply insert a line of code in your sidebar file to display the desired widget.

Second, the plugin creates an entire community members section inside your blog. You can specify the sub-path where you want the members section to live (everything is still contained within the plugin folder - the pages are inserted by the plugin by hooking in to the WordPress template redirection system). The members section includes a paginated member listing page as well as individual member profile pages.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zipped plugin.
2. Unzip the plugin and move the mybloglog folder inside your wordpress plugins directory ([your blog directory]/wp-content/plugins).
3. Make the cache directory writable by your webserver (i.e. chmod 777 cache).
4. Login to WordPress as an administrator and click on the Plugins tab.
5. Find the MyBlogLog plugin and click on Activate

For more details, read the [documentation](http://sitening.com/mybloglog/documentation.html).

The documentation is also included in the plugin and is accessible through the plugin configuration page.
